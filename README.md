# Inception
42 school common core project.
## Purpose
Project to learn how to use Docker. My goal was to make communicate the following containers: Nginx, Wordpress, and Mariadb with my own images.
## Download and Installation
The project has been made with docker and docker compose, you must have the both installed to compile.
```
git clone https://github.com/Stelviaa/Inception.git
cd Inception
make
```
Once the containers have finished compiling, you can go [here](https://localhost:443).
When you arrive on the website, the browser displays a warning, this is because the ssl certificate is self-signed. It's not a problem, you can still go to the site.
